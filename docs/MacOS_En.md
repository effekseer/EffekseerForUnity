# Regarding macOS warnings

The macOS native plugin (`EffekseerUnity.dylib`) is basically notarized by maintainers.
In normal usage, users do not need to notarize it.
If you build the native plugin by yourself, notarization is required.

## CI notarization settings (for maintainers)

See:

- `docs/Development/MacOSNotarizationCI.md`
- `docs/Development/MacOSNotarizationCI_ja.md`
